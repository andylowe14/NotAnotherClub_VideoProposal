    <h1>Video editing services proposal - Not Another Club</h1>
    
    <div class="intro">
        <p>Dear Sophia - I recently learned that you were looking for someone to help you create paid ads and trailers for your online hair and beauty industry membership community. After researching your business and website I have to say I am very impressed and intrigued, and I believe I can definitely add value to your operation and deliver the results you are looking for - driving more memberships to your platform.</p>

        <p><strong>I create promotional videos that convert viewers into paying customers.</strong> My work focuses on the same core challenge as paid ads - grabbing attention and driving real business results. The videos that I worked on for kickstarter campaigns for example are not traditional 'adverts' but they have the same goal, engagement, capturing attention and keeping it. Ultimately this leads to viewer conversion and sales.</p>

        <p>I'm excited about <em>Not Another Club</em> because your brand is all about fun, authenticity and originality - exactly the kind of project where I do my best work. I cannot wait to hear about your ideas for the content you want to create.</p>

        <p>Here are three examples of my work:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h2>Record-Breaking Kickstarter Campaign</h2>
        <div class="project-image">
            <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lazarus-press/the-devil-in-the-19th-century-vol-2" target="_blank">

            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="project-content">
            <p>I created the promotional videos for Lazarus Press's book launch campaigns. This was an incredibly niche project that required the right sort of content to engage the target audience. Understanding what would resonate with the client's audience was an essential skill when working on this project.</p>
            
            <p>The client had a vision which was a handmade, artisarial aesthetic, using original book illustrations in a stop-motion style. The client was very determined to pursue this route as a key differentiator in a landscape that is quickly becoming overrun with obviously AI-generated content. I also handled all the sound design and music arrangement - cutting together classical pieces to match the storytelling and create an emotional journey. I also composed the dramatic organ theme for the first campaign's finale.</p>
            
            <p>The results speak for themselves - both videos were central to campaigns that broke records for book launches on Kickstarter.</p>
            
            <div class="results-section">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lazarus-press/the-devil-in-the-19th-century/description" target="_blank">Campaign 1</a>:</strong> Over 1,000 backers, Â£90,000 raised</li>
                    <li><strong>Campaign 2:</strong> Â£75,000+ in the first 48 hours alone</li>
                    <li>Both campaigns were featured by Kickstarter as quality projects</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Natracare needed a 1-minute video demonstrating that their wipes actually dissolve like toilet paper. Sounds simple, but the challenge was making something that people would actually want to watch and share, not just skip past.</p>
            
            <p>I kept it light-hearted and snappy, getting straight to the point while making the science visually engaging. The client wanted it to grab attention immediately and deliver the message clearly.</p>

            <p>A blockchain wallet needed to announce their new app integration. Their brand is "Nautilus" so they wanted something with a submarine theme.

            <p>The whole thing needed to feel both vintage and cutting-edge, matching their community's vibe perfectly.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Andy Lowe, based in Bristol, UK. I've been editing video professionally since 2021, with a background in music production, composition, and sound design.</p>
                
                <p>I work best with clients who have real passion for what they're doing, who are mission-based. When you care deeply about your project, I feed off that energy and go the extra mile to make it exceptional. I have a 100% client retention rate - every client I've worked with has given me more work and referred others.</p>

        <p>I'd love to hear more about your vision for the paid ads and trailers. I think I can create something that really captures the <em>Not Another Club</em> vibe while bringing in new members.</p>

        <p>If you're interested, we could have a quick chat about what you're thinking. From there I can put together some ideas to show you how I'd tackle it.</p>

        <p><strong>Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further!</strong></p>
